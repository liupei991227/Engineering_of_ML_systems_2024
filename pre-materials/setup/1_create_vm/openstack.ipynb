    "# Create a Virtual Machine in CSC cPouta\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to create a virtual machine in cPouta.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For your interest, cPouta and ePouta are the IaaS cloud services at CSC, known as Finnish IT center for science. The cPouta cloud is the public cloud which is easily accessible via the Internet. The ePouta cloud is a virtual private cloud designed to meet the security requirements of handling sensitive data. Both the cPouta and ePouta clouds run on the OpenStack cloud software. The Pouta cloud services are suitable for most kinds of computational workloads and any other supporting services these workloads might need. More information can be found from [CSC's documentations of the Pouta services](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/pouta-what-is/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## First glance at cPouta\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to create and manage a virtual machine in cPouta from our local computer using OpenStack Python SDK. If you are interested, you can start familiarizing with cPouta GUI reading [this guide](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. You should already have a CSC account and can access the CSC project of the course\n",
    "If not, please navigate to the course Moodle page and find the invitation link. Then follow the instructions to create an CSC account and apply for the access to the CSC project of the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Downloading credentials for accessing cPouta\n",
    "To be able to connect to cPouta, we need to get some credentials. he credential file can be downloaded from the OpenStack web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the credential file at the following URL after logging in. **Remember to switch to project_2008075 if you have multiple CSC projects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/\n",
    "\n",
    "To download this in the web interface, navigate to the API Access section, and download the `clouds.yaml` file. `clouds.yaml` is needed to access cPouta using OpenStack Python SDK. (The OpenStack RC file is needed to access cPouta from a terminal using OpenStack CLI and we don't need it here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![api_access](./images/csc-pouta-openstack-api_access.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already access the cPouta dashboard, these links might work to download the files directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/clouds.yaml/\n",
    "\n",
    "Put the file in the current directory (setup/1_create_vm). \n",
    "> If you are using Firefox pre-installed in Ubuntu, the browser should ask you where to put the downloaded files. If this is not the case, this option can be enabled with the following steps:\n",
    "> 1. Open the setting menu by clicking on the three horizontal lines (hamburger icon) in the top-right corner of the Firefox window.\n",
    "> 2. Click on \"Settings\" and then \"General\".\n",
    "> 3. Navigate to the \"Files and Applications\" section and check the \"Always ask you where to save files\" checkbox. Now you can download the files again. \n"
