    "# Create a Virtual Machine in CSC cPouta\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to create a virtual machine in cPouta.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For your interest, cPouta and ePouta are the IaaS cloud services at CSC, known as Finnish IT center for science. The cPouta cloud is the public cloud which is easily accessible via the internet. The ePouta cloud is a virtual private cloud designed to meet the security requirements of handling sensitive data. Both the cPouta and ePouta clouds run on the OpenStack cloud software. The Pouta cloud services are suitable for most kinds of computational workloads and any other supporting services these workloads might need. More information can be found from [CSC's documentations of the Pouta services](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/pouta-what-is/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## First glance at cPouta\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to create and manage a virtual machine from our local computer using OpenStack CLI. If you are interested, you can start familiarizing with cPouta GUI reading [this guide](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. You should already have a CSC account and can access the CSC project of the course\n",
    "If not, please navigate to the course Moodle page and find the invitation link. Then follow the instructions to create an CSC account and apply for the access to the CSC project of the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Configure your terminal environment for OpenStack\n",
    "To be able to connect to the CSC system and cPouta, we need to get some credentials.\n",
    "We can set them using a script provided in the OpenStack web interface.\n",
    "You can download this script at the following URL after logging in. **Remember to switch to project_2008075 if you have multiple CSC projects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/\n",
    "\n",
    "To download this in the web interface, navigate to the API Access section, and download both files.\n",
    "\n",
    "![api_access](./images/csc-pouta-openstack-api_access.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already access the cPouta dashboard, these links might work to download the files directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/openrc/\n",
    "> https://pouta.csc.fi/dashboard/project/api_access/clouds.yaml/\n",
    "\n",
    "Put the files in the current directory (setup/1_create_vm). \n",
    "> If you are using Firefox pre-installed in the Ubuntu VM, the browser should ask you where to put the downloaded files. If this is not the case, this option can be enabled with the following steps:\n",
    "> 1. Open the setting menu by clicking on the three horizontal lines (hamburger icon) in the top-right corner of the Firefox window.\n",
    "> 2. Click on \"Settings\" and then \"General\".\n",
    "> 3. Navigate to the \"Files and Applications\" section and check the \"Always ask you where to save files\" checkbox. Now you can download the files again. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, rename the `project_2008075-openrc.sh` file as `openrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The openrc file will be necessary to use the OpenStack CLI (command line interface). While the cloud.yaml file is necessary to use OpenStack with the Python API.\n"

    "### 2. Install OpenStack CLI (command line interface)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a quite complete guide to install the CLI [here](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/install-client/), so if you need extra help you can use that one.\n",
    "The following is a faster step-by-step guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Unfortunately we can't run the OpenStack CLI in the python notebook because we will need the credentials from the openrc file, so you will need to open a terminal and follow along with the terminal on the side. This will be easy if you use VSCode. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the openrc script from the web UI, open a terminal and ensure you are under the `setup/1_create_vm` directory and add the environment variables in the terminal using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# suppose you're now under engineering_of_ml_systems, you can enter the 1_create_vm directory by \n",
    "cd pre_materials/setup/1_create_vm\n",
    "\n",
    "# then add environment variables\n",
    "source openrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be asked to enter a password. **Please use the password of your CSC account (not your university account)**. After doing this, the current terminal session will have the proper environment variables for using the command line tools. Unfortunately, you will not get any error even if you enter a wrong password, but a wrong password will cause errors in later procedures. To avoid this, you can print the password you just entered by running the following command in the same terminal and check if the printed password is correct:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo $OS_PASSWORD\n",
    "``` \n",
    "**⚠️ NOTE:** You need to do this again if you open a new terminal during setting up a VM in cPouta.\n"
